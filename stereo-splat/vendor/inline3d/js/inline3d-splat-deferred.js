// PlayCanvas handle here. This module must never import `three` or `@sparkjsdev/spark`, directly
// or through anything it imports: that is what lets ./splat/playcanvas keep both off the page
// (test/splat-pc-entry.test.mjs walks the import graph to hold it to that).

/**
 * The `engine: 'playcanvas'` handle, returned SYNCHRONOUSLY like the Spark one.
 *
 * The adapter module is loaded on demand, so for a moment the handle exists before its
 * implementation does. Rather than make every caller await something new, the handle starts as
 * stubs that QUEUE: `exclude()` (which a product page calls on the very next line), `setPose`,
 * `setFocus`, `remove` — and the adapter replays the queue into the real implementation, on the
 * SAME object, the moment it arrives. `ready` resolves to this object, as it does on Spark.
 * Fields (`viewer`, `mesh`, `rig`, …) are null until then; `viewer` in particular appears one
 * module-load later than on Spark.
