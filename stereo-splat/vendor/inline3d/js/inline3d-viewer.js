// inline3d-viewer.js — a framed, orbitable three.js object inside an inline-3D window.
//
// EXPERIMENTAL. Not covered by the SDK's 1.x semver promise — see docs/sdk-stability.md.
//
// inline3d.js hands a scene window the two eye XRViews each frame and stops there: what you
// render is your problem. That is the right boundary for the core, but every product that
// shows "one object in a tile, look around it, drag to spin" then rewrites the same five
// things — and gets at least one of them subtly wrong. This module is those five things:
//
//   1. The side-by-side render loop, with the pixelRatio/viewport rule that fails deceptively.
//   2. Auto-FRAMING: put the subject at z=0 (the zero-disparity plane, i.e. in focus) and size
//      it to the tile — including the depth clamp that a naive "fit" forgets.
//   3. Orbit + zoom, rotating about the SUBJECT rather than the world origin.
//   4. An idle turntable, because a still product reads as a photo.
//   5. The mono fallback, so the same page works in any browser.
//
// It is content-agnostic: put anything in `viewer.content`. `./splat` and `./model` are thin
// wrappers that load an asset into it. Use this directly if you have your own three.js content
// and just want the framing and interaction.
//
//   import * as THREE from 'three';
//   import { createInline3D } from '@displayxr/inline3d';
//   import { EyeCamera } from '@displayxr/inline3d/three';
//   import { SceneViewer } from '@displayxr/inline3d/viewer';
//
//   const viewer = new SceneViewer(THREE, canvas, { virtualDisplayHeight: 0.18 });
//   viewer.useEyeCamera(EyeCamera);            // REQUIRED for stereo; ./splat and ./model do it
//   viewer.content.add(myMesh);
//   viewer.fitTo(center, extent);              // model-space bounds of the subject
//   const wall = await createInline3D();
//   if (wall.supported)
//     wall.addScene(canvas, viewer.onFrame, {
//       virtualDisplayHeight: 0.18,
//       onLayerLost: viewer.onLayerLost,   // the session ended: go flat rather than show raw SBS
//     });
//   else viewer.startMono();
//
// WHY FRAMING IS SCENE-GRAPH WORK AND NOT A RIG FIELD. The native display rig
// (XrDisplayRigDXR) carries a POSE as well as a virtual display height, and the native viewers
// auto-frame by setting both: pose.position = the subject's centre, virtualDisplayHeight = its
// extent. The web session exposes only the height. That costs nothing, because the SDK's
// authoring contract already says "put focused content at z=0" — so we move the content to the
// origin and scale it, instead of moving the display to the content. Identical framing, no
// browser or runtime change.

// Every tuning constant — damping, idle delay, focus ease, wheel, zoom and pitch clamps, the
// mono camera — lives in ./inline3d-splat-shared.js, where the PlayCanvas splat backend reads the
// same numbers. The reasoning behind each value is documented there.

/**
 * Robust model-space bounds from a flat array of splat/vertex centres.
 *
 * TWO STAGES, because one percentile box cannot do both jobs. A raw min/max is useless on
 * captured content — one stray floater a hundred metres out and the subject shrinks to a speck —
 * but a trimmed box is equally useless as an EXTENT, because the tail it drops on a dense subject
 * is the subject's own outer shell. Trimming 5% per axis under-reported seven scanned products by
 * 10-15%, which the fit then faithfully turned into a subject overflowing its tile.
 *
 * So: percentiles REJECT, true min/max MEASURES.
 *   1. Percentile core (lo..hi per axis) — an outlier-proof estimate of where the subject is.
 *   2. True min/max over centres inside `expand` x that core, centred on it.
 * A floater sits orders of magnitude outside the core and is still rejected; a shell splat sits
 * just past the percentile cut and is now kept.
 *
 * This is the CHEAP path. The native viewers additionally run an opacity-weighted voxel
 * flood-fill (`getMainObjectBounds`) that isolates the dominant contiguous object from an
 * air-gap-separated background — which matters on image→splat scenes, where the background
 * wall is part of the reconstruction. That is deliberately NOT reimplemented here: it wants
 * every centre resident and a 64³ pass before the first frame. Compute it at conversion time
 * and pass the result to `fitTo()` instead; fall back to this when there is no such sidecar.
 * (Precedent: the Adreno/mobile native renderer ships exactly this percentile-only path.)
