// inline3d-undock.js — lift a window's 3D asset OUT of the page into a floating, transparent,
// click-through native viewer over the desktop. Dependency-free, and usable on its own.
//
// TWO PATHS, ONE CONTRACT. Where the browser exposes `XRDisplayLayer.undock()` the request goes
// straight through it: the layer already knows its element's rect, and the viewer opens with no
// prompt. Everywhere else the page spawns the same viewer through the `displayxr-view:` OS
// protocol — the spawn primitive every browser hands a page (Chrome asks once, "Open DisplayXR
// …?", with an "Always allow" tick). The URL grammar below is the contract both paths share, and
// it is the one parsed by displayxr-common's `launch_args.h`.
//
// WHY A NATIVE PROCESS AND NOT A WINDOW. The browser's inline-3D weave is bound to ONE window per
// process and hands back opaque pixels into the page's own compositing, so no browser window can
// be the transparent floating one. The floating window is a native process; the page's only job
// is to spawn it with the asset URL and the tile's screen rect.
//
// NOTHING HERE TOUCHES THE TILE. Undock READS an element's rect and never writes to it, so it
// cannot disturb a woven window — the button that calls it lives in the page's own chrome.
