/**
 * Load a splat into an inline-3D window.
 *
 * @param {object} wall  the manager from createInline3D(), supported or not.
 * @param {HTMLCanvasElement} canvas
 * @param {string} src  URL of a .sog / .spz / .ply / .splat / .ksplat.
 * @param {object} [opts]
 * @param {number} [opts.virtualDisplayHeight=0.24]  metres of world the tile's height spans.
 * @param {{center:number[],extent:number[]}} [opts.frame]  precomputed subject bounds. STRONGLY
 *        preferred — see "Framing" below.
 * @param {boolean} [opts.flipY=true]  apply the 180° X flip that most splat exports need.
 * @param {number} [opts.idleSpin=8]  degrees/second of turntable once idle. 0 to disable.
 * @param {boolean} [opts.orbit=true]  drag to spin, wheel to zoom.
 * @param {'contain'|'height'|'cover'|'none'} [opts.fit='contain']
 * @param {number} [opts.margin=0.8]  fraction of the tile the subject may occupy — neither its
 *        width nor its height exceeds this, whatever its proportions.
 * @param {number} [opts.depthLimit=4.0]  backstop on total depth; rarely binds.
 * @param {boolean} [opts.fitSweep=true]  fit the horizontal against the box's diagonal, so a
 *        long subject still fits once the turntable turns it.
 * @param {number} [opts.renderScale=1]  per-eye buffer scale; 0.5–0.7 is usually free.
 * @param {number} [opts.feather=0]  edge fade in buffer px.
 * @param {number} [opts.sortIntervalMs=16]  see DEFAULT_SORT_INTERVAL_MS.
 * @param {true|'exact'|'balanced'|'aggressive'|object} [opts.perf]  cut overdraw. Unset (the
 *        default) changes nothing: every Spark default stays where Spark put it. `'exact'` is the
 *        bit-exact pair (each quad shrunk to its own 1/255 alpha radius, plus the 1/255 opacity
 *        cull) and buys little on a mostly-opaque capture; `'balanced'` (also `true`) and
 *        `'aggressive'` tighten the quad extent, which is the axis that measured. Every knob,
 *        what it costs in pixels, and the measurements: ./inline3d-splat-perf.js.
 * @param {'auto'|'display'|'camera'} [opts.rig='auto']  which view rig. `auto` asks the ASSET:
 *        the `camera` block's own `rig`, or — for a block that does not say — a camera rig,
 *        since a block at all means a camera was recorded. No block is a display rig with the
 *        auto-frame, which is what every existing page already has. Only read from BYTES. On the
 *        camera path the subject is NOT reframed and the idle turntable is off unless you asked
 *        for one. Full waterfall: ./inline3d-splat-rig.js.
 * @param {number[]} [opts.focus]  the point to converge on and orbit about, in the splat's own
 *        space. Top of the focus waterfall; below it the block's `focus.point`, then the median
 *        disparity of the cloud, then 2 m.
 * @param {number} [opts.convergence]  the straight-ahead shorthand for `focus`: a distance in
 *        world metres along the capture's view axis.
 * @param {object} [opts.intrinsics]  override the lens ({fx,fy,cx,cy,width,height}, one eye,
 *        OpenCV). Only consulted when the asset carries none.
 * @param {number} [opts.ipdFactor=1]  camera rig eye separation, ABSOLUTE.
 * @param {number} [opts.parallaxFactor=1]  camera rig head-tracking response, ABSOLUTE.
 * @param {boolean} [opts.focusInput=true]  bind double-click (focus what was clicked) and Space
 *        (back to the resolved focus).
 * @param {Element} [opts.observe=canvas]  element whose visibility gates the lazy lifecycle.
 * @returns {object} a TileHandle (remove/exclude/unexclude) plus `viewer`, `mesh`, `setPose`,
 *          `resetPose`, `frame` (the bounds used, null until loaded) and `ready` (a promise).
 *          SYNCHRONOUS on purpose — it mirrors addImage, so a caller can wire up overlays and
 *          controls immediately instead of awaiting a download first.
 *
 * FRAMING. A splat has no natural "front" or size, so something must decide where the subject
 * is and how big to draw it. Pass `opts.frame` when you can: the native pipeline already
 * computes exactly these bounds with an opacity-weighted voxel flood-fill that separates the
 * subject from an air-gapped background, and baking that into a sidecar at conversion time
 * costs the page nothing. Without it we fall back to trimmed percentile bounds computed here —
 * good enough for a clean, isolated capture, weaker on a scene with a background wall.

 * indistinguishable from percentiles of two million, at a tenth of the cost.
 *
 * The result is lifted out of the mesh's LOCAL space through its own matrix, because by the
 * time this runs the Y-flip is already on the mesh — and the viewer centres content one level
 * above it. Skip that and every flipped capture frames to a point mirrored through the origin,

 * matrix itself. That is not a contradiction of "declare the rig, never compute": the 3D path
 * below sends a descriptor and consumes the runtime's views as always — but the mono fallback has
 * no runtime and no stereo, so SOMETHING has to render the capture, and the honest thing to
 * render is the capture's own frustum. Get it wrong and the flat view is a crop or a zoom of the
 * photograph, which reads as a framing bug.
 *
 * THE FLIP MOVES THE CAMERA TOO. `flipY` puts a 180° X rotation on the MESH (most exports are
 * Y-down; three is Y-up), so a rest pose recorded in the file's own frame has to ride the same
 * rotation or the camera ends up mirrored through the origin — the identity pose the gallery's
 * assets carry hides this completely, which is exactly why it is done properly here.
 *
 * ASPECT. The intrinsics fix the capture's aspect and the canvas has its own. The vertical is
 * kept and the horizontal is widened or narrowed to the canvas — `fit:'height'`'s convention, and
 * the one that keeps a face the same size whatever shape the tile is. The principal point rides
 * along, so a deconverged capture (`cx` off centre) keeps its lens shift.
 *
 * `updateProjectionMatrix` is REPLACED, not just called: the viewer recomputes it on every
 * resize, and three's symmetric version would silently throw the off-axis window away on the
