// inline3d-splat-perf.js — cut a Gaussian splat's OVERDRAW, for `./splat`.
//
// EXPERIMENTAL. Internal to `./splat`, which re-exports `applySplatPerf` and takes `perf` as an
// option. Not covered by the SDK's 1.x semver promise — see docs/sdk-stability.md.
//
// WHAT COSTS WHAT. On a 1.18M-gaussian photo-lifted scene the per-fragment composite is 75–85 %
// of the frame (measured natively on an M1 Pro, one eye at 1920×1080), and it is OVERDRAW, not
// resolution: a handful of enormous, nearly transparent sky splats cover the frame many times
// over. Splat COUNT is the axis everyone reaches for first and it is the wrong one — decimating
// this asset to 25 % breaks it visibly (bright stipple on near lit surfaces) while removing far
// less fill than the two changes below, which remove none of the picture at all.
//
// The two that matter, in the native renderer's words: **shrink each splat's quad to the radius
// where its alpha falls below 1/255**, instead of a fixed 3σ, and **cull gaussians whose peak
// opacity is already below 1/255**. This module is both of those on Spark.
//
// WHY THE FIRST ONE IS FREE. Spark draws every splat as a quad of `maxStdDev` σ (default √8 ≈
// 2.83σ) and its fragment shader then discards any fragment whose alpha has fallen under
// `minAlpha` — so for a splat of peak alpha `a` every fragment beyond
//
//     r = sqrt(2 · ln(a / minAlpha))
//
// is ALREADY being discarded. It is rasterised, interpolated, shaded, and thrown away. Shrinking
// the quad to exactly that radius therefore removes fragments that contributed nothing: the
// output is bit-identical (see `alphaRadius` below for the two conditions), and the saving is
// biggest on exactly the splats that dominate the cost — a haze splat of a = 0.02 needs 1.81σ,
// not 2.83σ, which is 2.4× fewer fragments for the same pixels.
//
// Spark 2.1.0 has no option for that (`maxStdDev` is ONE global uniform, and nothing in the
// shader derives a radius from alpha), so this patches the vertex shader — through the supported
// `vertexShader` surface, and by REWRITING SPARK'S OWN SOURCE off the live material rather than
// shipping a copy of it, so a Spark upgrade brings its shader fixes with it instead of silently
// pinning this SDK to a fork of a 2.1.0 file. If the anchors ever stop matching, the patch
// declines with one warning and everything still renders.

 * table in docs/authoring-inline-3d.md):
 *
 *   - **Splat COUNT is not the cost.** 50 % and 25 % decimations of the same scene measured
 *     within noise of the full one (+5 %, +1 % at 1920×1080). Decimation drops the small
 *     gaussians; the few enormous ones that cover the frame survive it, and they are the bill.
 *     A decimated asset is a download and memory win, not a render-cost win.
 *   - **Quad extent is the cost.** `maxStdDev` √8→√6 is −5…−20 % and √8→√4 is −22 %.
 *   - **The bit-exact `alphaRadius` buys ~nothing HERE**, because it has nothing to shrink: 86 %
 *     of this asset's gaussians are near-opaque (mean peak alpha 0.86; Spark doubles the stored
 *     alpha on top), and an opaque splat's own 1/255 radius is 3.53σ, wider than the √8 ≈ 2.83σ
 *     it is already drawn at. It stays available and stays exact — a scene of large, low-alpha
 *     haze is exactly where it pays, and that is the scene the native renderer was tuned on.
 *
 * So the presets are honest about which axis works, and nothing is applied unless a caller asks:
 * `addSplat` with no `perf` leaves every Spark default exactly where Spark put it.

It cannot be turned off, so `alphaRadius: false` is reported as `'native'`. |
// | `minAlpha` | `scene.gsplat.alphaClipForward` | engine default is already 1/255 |
// | `maxStdDev` | chunk override of `gsplatCommonVS` | the engine's quad is a fixed √8σ; the override caps `clipCorner`'s scale at `maxStdDev/√8`, which truncates both the quad AND the gaussian's uv, i.e. Spark's semantics. Only ever SHRINKS (≤ √8σ). |

/**
 * Cap the engine's per-splat quad at `k` of its √8σ extent — Spark's `maxStdDev`, on PlayCanvas.
 *
 * Rewrites `clipCorner`'s `min(1.0, …)` to `min(k, …)`, which scales the corner offset AND the uv
 * the fragment shader evaluates the gaussian at, so the tail is truncated rather than the
 * profile squashed. Returns the source unchanged (and `ok:false`) when the anchor is missing;
 * the caller warns once and renders at the engine's own extent.
 *
 * The rewritten line is adapted from PlayCanvas engine src/scene/shader-lib/glsl/chunks/gsplat/vert/
 * gsplatCommon.js (the `gsplatCommonVS` chunk's clipCorner) @ v2.22.3, MIT (THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).
 *
 * @param {string} src  the current `gsplatCommonVS` chunk.
 * @param {number} k  in (0, 1).
 * @returns {{src:string, ok:boolean}}
