// inline3d.js — the DisplayXR inline-3D SDK. Dependency-free.
//
// Turn any HTML <canvas> into a glasses-free-3D "window" on a DisplayXR display, inside an
// otherwise ordinary web page. One page, one WebXR session, MANY weaved windows — and any
// content:
//   • a still side-by-side (SBS) 3D photo          → wall.addImage(canvas, url)
//   • an SBS 3D video / movie                       → wall.addVideo(canvas, videoEl)
//   • a live-rendered stereo scene (three.js, WebGL) → wall.addScene(canvas, onFrame)
//
// The DisplayXR runtime batches every visible window into ONE weave call per frame, so a
// scrolling wall of many 3D windows stays cheap. This SDK keeps that easy: it owns the
// fiddly parts (the SBS buffer contract, correct feature-detection, the compositor-layer
// hint, and — for many windows — a lazy create/close lifecycle) so your page code is short.
//
// ── THE ONE CONTRACT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A weaved window is a <canvas> whose BACKING BUFFER holds side-by-side stereo — the left
// eye in the left half, the right eye in the right half — while its on-screen CSS box is
// whatever shape you want the viewer to see. The weave un-squishes the two halves back onto
// the box. So a square 3D photo is a 2:1 buffer in a square box; a 16:9 3D movie is a 32:9
// buffer in a 16:9 box. addImage/addVideo maintain this for you; addScene hands you the two
// eye viewports and you render into them.
//
// On any non-DisplayXR browser (or a 2D monitor) createInline3D() resolves to
// { supported:false } and your page shows its normal 2D content — inline-3D is progressive
// enhancement, never a hard dependency.

// Undock lives in its own module (it is a page-level action, not a per-frame concern, and it
// works standalone on a browser with no inline-3D at all). Imported here for ONE reason: to hand
// it a resolver so its API-first path can find the live XRDisplayLayer behind an element. The
// dependency runs one way — inline3d-undock.js imports nothing — so there is no cycle, and the
// three entry points are re-exported below so a page has a single import site.

// weaving the same fixed two-view atlas); request the two-view mode and the panel goes back to
// 3D. The transition arrives as `hardwaredisplaystatechange`. There is deliberately NO
// page-facing request for the hardware state on its own: a page that could move the panel flat

// ── draw-order occlusion (browser Phase 2, browser patches 0063/0064) ─────────────────────
//
// The browser composites ANY 2D content over a woven tile per-pixel BY DRAW ORDER — headers,
// badges, dropdowns, translucent scrims, even a full-tile plate — with nothing declared by the
// page. Every exclusion mechanism in this file (auto-chrome, page-global overlays,
// data-inline3d-overlay, handle.exclude) exists only to fake that on browsers without it, so
// where it is on, all of it stands down.
//
// DETECTION IS A CAPABILITY READ, NEVER A VERSION. `excludeElement` is still fully present on a
// Phase-2 browser (the browser change is viz-side; it touches no Blink file, and the declarations
// are collected as before and simply have no effect downstream), so `hasExclusion()` cannot tell
// the generations apart — and a UA/version gate is worthless for a page that pins an SDK for
// years. The signal is a capability flag the browser exposes; ABSENT today, so this reads false
// on everything currently shipping and the legacy path below runs unchanged.
//
// TWO THINGS THE FLAG'S SHAPE HAS TO RESPECT, both learned the hard way:
//  1. NEVER read the value off `XRDisplayLayer.prototype`. A Blink IDL attribute getter throws
//     `TypeError: Illegal invocation` when its receiver is the prototype instead of an instance,
//     so the "obvious" probe `!!XRDisplayLayer.prototype.occlusionByDrawOrder` would THROW on
//     precisely the browser it is meant to detect. `'x' in prototype` is safe (no getter call)
//     but reports only presence.
//  2. Presence is not the answer. The browser's split is switch-gated
//     (`--inline-3d-occlusion`, off by default until it becomes the default), so a build that
//     HAS the attribute can still legitimately report false, and the truth is process-wide
//     rather than per-layer.
// Hence the shape asked of the browser: a STATIC readonly boolean on the interface object,
// `XRDisplayLayer.occlusionByDrawOrder` — process-wide like the switch it reflects, readable
// with no session and no layer (a page decides its DOM before it ever creates one), and immune
// to (1) because there is no prototype receiver involved. Should the flag instead land as a
// per-instance attribute, sampleDrawOrderOcclusion() below picks it up off the first live layer.

 *
 * @param {object} [opts]

 * @param {boolean} [opts.lazy=true]  Create each window's weave layer only while it is
 *        (near-)visible and close it when it scrolls away — so a long wall only pays for
 *        what's on screen. Set false for a single always-on element.
 * @param {string} [opts.rootMargin='50% 0px']  IntersectionObserver margin for lazy mode;
 *        the default pre-arms a window half a viewport early so a fast scroll never shows a
 *        raw (un-woven) frame.
 * @param {boolean} [opts.autoChrome=true]  Auto-exclude page chrome: sticky/fixed elements
 *        near the top of the DOM (headers, toolbars) are registered as page-global overlays
 *        automatically — the bar itself plus its text/replaced descendants — so woven
 *        windows scroll UNDER the chrome without any per-app wiring. Opt an element (and
 *        its subtree) out with `data-inline3d-no-overlay`; set false to manage chrome
 *        exclusively via addGlobalOverlay()/data-inline3d-overlay. Ignored (nothing is
 *        scanned, no `will-change` is set on your DOM) on a browser with draw-order
 *        occlusion, where chrome occludes tiles by itself.
 * @param {object} [opts.modeSwitch]  The EASED 2D<->3D transition, on by default.
 *        `{ durationMs=180, easing='smoothstep'|'linear'|'easeoutcubic', enabled=true }` — the
 *        same defaults the native DisplayXR apps configure. Instead of snapping the stereo rig
 *        the moment the panel's mode changes, a page-initiated switch ramps every window's
 *        `ipdFactor`/`parallaxFactor` between 0 and what the page asked for, in the order that
 *        looks right: going FLAT ramps the disparity out first and only then asks the panel to
 *        switch, and coming BACK asks first and eases the disparity in once the panel reports
 *        3D. `enabled:false` restores the plain snap. It is aesthetic policy only — the runtime
 *        keeps the eye set coherent either way — and a mode change the page did NOT request
 *        (another tab, the shell, a panel opening flat) always snaps, because there is nothing
 *        to ramp from. Read the live state on `wall.modeSwitch`.
 * @param {'none'|'mono'} [opts.untrackedFallback='none']  What the SDK does to the image and video
 *        windows it owns the pixels of while NOBODY IS TRACKED (`wall.trackingState ===
 *        'searching'`). WHOSE JOB THIS IS depends on the display's eye-tracking mode (runtime
 *        spec docs/specs/vendor/eye-tracking-modes.md). MANAGED — the default, and Leia's — the
 *        vendor owns tracking loss: it eases the eyes together and only reports 'searching' once
 *        the display is already 2D, so leave this at `'none'` (a flatten here would be a second
 *        transition). MANUAL — the vendor does nothing and the app handles it: set `'mono'`.
 *        `'none'` (default) changes nothing. `'mono'` eases each image/video window to its LEFT
 *        EYE IN BOTH HALVES of its side-by-side buffer on 'searching' (still a valid pair for the
 *        layer; no buffer reallocation) and back on 'tracking', over the mode switch's duration;
 *        'unknown' leaves it where it is. Scene windows are never touched: the page owns those
 *        pixels — listen for `trackingstatechange` and do the same for a scene.
 * @param {boolean|{enabled?:boolean,durationMs?:number,easing?:string}} [opts.viewerEase]  The
 *        default, for every SDK renderer drawing through this session (`./viewer`'s SceneViewer,
 *        `./splat`, `./model`, both engines), of the TRACKING EASE: when a viewer is acquired
 *        (the views jump from the runtime's nominal viewer to the tracked eyes) or lost, the eye
 *        views glide from where they were drawn to the new ones over `durationMs` (300) on
 *        `easing` ('smoothstep' | 'linear' | 'easeOutCubic') instead of snapping in one frame.
 *        On by default; `false` restores the snap. A renderer's own `viewerEase` option
 *        overrides this. A page rendering its own addScene uses the exported `ViewerEase`.
 * @returns {Promise<Inline3D | {supported:false, trackingState:'unknown', error?:Error}>} the
 *        manager, which also carries
 *        the display API (`getDisplayInfo` / `getRenderingModes` / `requestRenderingMode` /

   * The per-eye buffer size this window should have right now: explicit, or box × dpr — capped
   * at the SOURCE's own per-eye resolution for image and video windows.
   *
   * WHY THE CAP (measured, NP02J tablet, DisplayXR Browser 1.0.6): the player sample's 90vw
   * tile at dpr 2 asked for a 4608×1296 backing store for a 640×360-per-eye clip — 13× the
   * source's pixels, re-drawn every frame. The page fell to 25 fps and dropped 47 of 97 video
   * frames; the same clip in a 45vw tile (2304×648) ran at 57 fps with 0 dropped. Drawing a
   * source into a buffer larger than itself adds no detail: the compositor scales the layer to
   * the box either way, so upscaling here only spends GPU fill-rate. The cap keeps the BOX
   * aspect (the eyes stay correctly shaped) and only shrinks, never grows past box × dpr.
   * An explicit {width, height} is the page's call and is never capped by the source.
   *
   * THEN THE DEVICE LIMIT, on every window including an explicit size: the whole store (2 × eye
   * wide in SBS) must fit min(MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE, MAX_RENDERBUFFER_SIZE, MAX_VIEWPORT_DIMS), or
   * the weave cannot take it as one texture. An Android 3D tablet (Adreno 740) reports 4096 where
   * desktops report 16384. Both axes shrink by one factor (./inline3d-buffer-limit.js), warned
   * once per window. `win.bufScale` records the total shrink so buffer-px decoration
   * (cornerRadius, feather) keeps its on-screen size.
